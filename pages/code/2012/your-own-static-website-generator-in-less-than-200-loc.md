title: A static site generator in less than 200 LOC

It's been a long time I wanted to federate my online identities in a single, managed place â€” hence the website you're currently browsing. I've also been looking for a static website builder for some times, trying many and retaining zero. It was a bit depressing, frustrating to say the least.

Then when I encountered [this tweet by Armin Ronacher](https://twitter.com/#!/mitsuhiko/statuses/166570613295689728):

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p>Frozen-Flask is really, really useful.

[Armin](http://lucumr.pocoo.org/) is the author of the [Flask microframework](http://flask.pocoo.org/), so this tweet immediately rang a bell and I started exploring the possibilities offered by [Frozen-Flask](http://packages.python.org/Frozen-Flask/).
