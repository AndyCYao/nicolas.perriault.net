## Welcome to my centralized piece of identity on the internetsâ„¢

My name is <strong>Nicolas Perriault</strong>, I'm 35, I live in southern France [near
Montpellier](http://g.co/maps/z88bs). I have a son, a wife, three cats and am pretty much <strong>enjoying my
life</strong>.

I'm a <strong>Web developer</strong>, I made coding a living. And as you may
suppose, I'm not a Web designer.

I also practice <strong>photography</strong>, and rant probably a bit too much.
