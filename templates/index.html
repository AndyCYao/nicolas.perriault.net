## Welcome to my centralized piece of identity on the internets.

My name is Nicolas Perriault, I'm 35, I live in southern France near
Montpellier. I have a son, a wife, three cats and am pretty much enjoying my
life.

I'm a developer, I made coding a living.

I also practice photography, and rant a bit too much.
